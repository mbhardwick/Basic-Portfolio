# Basic-Portfolio

!!! Note: The portfolio page is unfinished although I was able to solve a couple of issues in the last 30 minutes. I also would liked to have applied the sticky footer and cleaned up some but I've been stuck on positioning the portfolio for hours.

Basic Portfolio
This is a basic portfolio built using HTML and styled with CSS. The About Me page (index.html) lets visitors know a little about myself; the Portfolio displays placeholders for my future projects; and the contact page is a form that allows visitors to contact me.
